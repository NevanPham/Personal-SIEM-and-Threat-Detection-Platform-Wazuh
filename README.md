# Personal SIEM Lab - Wazuh

This is my documentation for setting up a personal SIEM lab with Wazuh. I'm still learning and working through this, so it's not finished yet. Check out the `docs` folder for setup guides, agent configuration, and other notes like features and panels and descriptions of the Wazuh dashboard I've been taking along the way.

Currently im getting used to all the features using the dashboard first, might learn the cli command and scripting later (or maybe no?)

Pls lmk if there's anything fun I can do with this lab, or just generally any way to make the learning process more exciting 🥸
