# Wazuh Dashboard – Overview

This section introduces the **Overview** page of the Wazuh dashboard.  
The Overview page provides a high-level summary of agent connectivity and recent alert activity, allowing operators to quickly confirm that the environment is functioning as expected.

## Agents Summary

### What it is

The **Agents Summary** panel displays the current connection status of all enrolled Wazuh agents.

Agents are grouped by status, such as:
- Active
- Disconnected
- Pending
- Never connected

This panel reflects whether endpoints are **visible and communicating** with the Wazuh manager.  
It does not provide information about threats, alerts, or system health beyond connectivity.

### Agent Details 

When selecting an individual agent from the Agents Summary panel, Wazuh presents a detailed view that describes the **current state, activity level, and security context** of that specific endpoint.

#### Agent Identity and Status

This section provides core identification and health information for the agent.

It includes:
- **Agent ID and name** - Unique identifiers used by Wazuh
- **Status** - Indicates whether the agent is currently active
- **IP address** - Network location of the endpoint
- **Agent version** - Installed Wazuh agent version
- **Operating system** - OS and version reported by the agent
- **Group** - Agent group that determines applied configuration
- **Cluster node** - Manager node handling the agent
- **Registration date** - When the agent was enrolled
- **Last keep-alive** - Timestamp of the most recent heartbeat

**Purpose**  
This section confirms that the agent is:
- Correctly enrolled
- Actively communicating
- Reporting up-to-date telemetry

It establishes trust in the data shown below.

---

#### System Inventory

The System Inventory section displays basic hardware and host information collected from the agent.

It typically includes:
- CPU model and number of cores
- Available memory
- Hostname
- Serial number (often absent for virtual machines)

**Purpose**  
Provides asset context for the endpoint without relying on an external inventory system.

**Interpretation (lab context)**  
Low resource values and missing serial numbers are expected for virtual machines.  
The presence of this data confirms that **inventory collection is functioning**.

---

#### Events Count Evolution

This section visualizes the number of events generated by the agent over time.

**Purpose**
- Shows overall activity level
- Highlights sudden spikes or unusual increases in event generation

**Interpretation (lab context)**  
A mostly flat or low-activity graph is normal in a quiet lab environment.

---

#### MITRE ATT&CK

The MITRE ATT&CK section summarizes how alerts generated by this agent map to **MITRE ATT&CK tactics**.

**Purpose**
- Categorizes detection rules into high-level adversary behavior classes
- Provides context on what *types* of behaviors rules are matching

**Interpretation (lab context)**  
Seeing tactics such as Defense Evasion or Privilege Escalation in a lab is common and often benign.

---

#### Compliance

The Compliance section maps alerts and checks to compliance frameworks such as **PCI DSS**.

**Purpose**
- Shows which compliance control categories are associated with observed signals
- Supports compliance-oriented visibility and reporting

**Interpretation (lab context)**  
Populated charts are expected and do not imply non-compliance or risk.

---

#### Vulnerability Detection

The **Vulnerability Detection** section summarizes known vulnerabilities identified on the agent based on installed packages.

It includes:
- Counts of detected vulnerabilities grouped by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- A list of the most frequently affected packages, if any are present

**Purpose**
- Provides visibility into known software vulnerabilities affecting the endpoint
- Confirms that vulnerability scanning is enabled and running

**Note**  
Detected vulnerabilities indicate **potential exposure**, not exploitation.  
The absence of findings does not guarantee that the system is secure.

**Lab interpretation**  
Zero or low findings are common in fresh or lightly used lab systems and do not reflect real-world exposure levels.

---

#### Security Configuration Assessment (SCA)

The **SCA: Latest scans** section shows the results of recent configuration assessments performed against security benchmarks.

It includes:
- The benchmark or policy used (e.g. CIS Ubuntu Linux Benchmark)
- Timestamp of the last completed scan
- Number of passed, failed, and not applicable checks
- An overall compliance score

**Purpose**
- Evaluates system configuration against hardening guidelines
- Provides a baseline view of security posture

**Note**  
Low scores are common on default installations.  
This does not indicate misconfiguration or compromise.

**Lab interpretation**  
Failing checks are expected unless the system has been explicitly hardened.

---

#### File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

The **FIM: Recent events** section displays recent file integrity events detected on the agent.

It includes:
- Timestamp of the event
- File path affected
- Action performed (e.g. modified)
- Rule description and severity level

**Purpose**
- Tracks changes to monitored files and directories
- Provides visibility into filesystem activity

**Lab interpretation**  
Seeing integrity events in a lab environment is normal and confirms that file integrity monitoring is functioning.

## Last 24 Hours Alerts

### What it is

The **Last 24 Hours Alerts** panel shows the number of alerts generated by Wazuh within the previous 24-hour period.

Alerts are typically broken down by:
- Time
- Severity level

This panel provides a quick overview of **recent alert activity** and helps identify sudden increases or unusual patterns in alert volume.

It represents **signals generated by detection rules**, not confirmed security incidents.
