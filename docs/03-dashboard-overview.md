# Wazuh Dashboard – Overview

This section introduces the **Overview** page of the Wazuh dashboard.  
The Overview page provides a high-level summary of agent connectivity and recent alert activity, allowing operators to quickly confirm that the environment is functioning as expected.

## Agents Summary

### What it is

The **Agents Summary** panel displays the current connection status of all enrolled Wazuh agents.

Agents are grouped by status, such as:
- Active
- Disconnected
- Pending
- Never connected

This panel reflects whether endpoints are **visible and communicating** with the Wazuh manager.  
It does not provide information about threats, alerts, or system health beyond connectivity.

### Agent Details – System Context Overview

When selecting an individual agent from the Agents Summary panel, Wazuh presents a detailed view that describes the **current state, activity level, and security context** of that specific endpoint.

This view is informational and contextual. It is used to understand *what kind of system this agent is* and *what types of signals it is producing*, not to confirm incidents.

---

#### Agent Identity and Status

This section provides core identification and health information for the agent.

It includes:
- **Agent ID and name** – Unique identifiers used by Wazuh
- **Status** – Indicates whether the agent is currently active
- **IP address** – Network location of the endpoint
- **Agent version** – Installed Wazuh agent version
- **Operating system** – OS and version reported by the agent
- **Group** – Agent group that determines applied configuration
- **Cluster node** – Manager node handling the agent
- **Registration date** – When the agent was enrolled
- **Last keep-alive** – Timestamp of the most recent heartbeat

**Purpose**  
This section confirms that the agent is:
- Correctly enrolled
- Actively communicating
- Reporting up-to-date telemetry

It establishes trust in the data shown below.

---

#### System Inventory

The System Inventory section displays basic hardware and host information collected from the agent.

It typically includes:
- CPU model and number of cores
- Available memory
- Hostname
- Serial number (often absent for virtual machines)

**Purpose**  
Provides asset context for the endpoint without relying on an external inventory system.

**Interpretation (lab context)**  
Low resource values and missing serial numbers are expected for virtual machines.  
The presence of this data confirms that **inventory collection is functioning**.

---

#### Events Count Evolution

This section visualizes the number of events generated by the agent over time.

**Purpose**
- Shows overall activity level
- Highlights sudden spikes or unusual increases in event generation

**Important note**  
This chart reflects **event volume**, not severity or maliciousness.

**Interpretation (lab context)**  
A mostly flat or low-activity graph is normal in a quiet lab environment.

---

#### MITRE ATT&CK

The MITRE ATT&CK section summarizes how alerts generated by this agent map to **MITRE ATT&CK tactics**.

**Purpose**
- Categorizes detection rules into high-level adversary behavior classes
- Provides context on what *types* of behaviors rules are matching

**Important note**  
This does **not** indicate an active attack.  
It is a classification layer applied to detection rules.

**Interpretation (lab context)**  
Seeing tactics such as Defense Evasion or Privilege Escalation in a lab is common and often benign.

---

#### Compliance

The Compliance section maps alerts and checks to compliance frameworks such as **PCI DSS**.

**Purpose**
- Shows which compliance control categories are associated with observed signals
- Supports compliance-oriented visibility and reporting

**Important note**  
This is **not an audit result** and does not represent pass/fail compliance.

**Interpretation (lab context)**  
Populated charts are expected and do not imply non-compliance or risk.

---

### Summary

Together, these sections describe the **current operational state** of the agent:
- It is active and reporting
- Inventory and telemetry collection are functioning
- Security signals are being categorized and visualized

They provide context and confidence in agent visibility, not confirmation of security incidents.

## Last 24 Hours Alerts

### What it is

The **Last 24 Hours Alerts** panel shows the number of alerts generated by Wazuh within the previous 24-hour period.

Alerts are typically broken down by:
- Time
- Severity level

This panel provides a quick overview of **recent alert activity** and helps identify sudden increases or unusual patterns in alert volume.

It represents **signals generated by detection rules**, not confirmed security incidents.
